# RuneWordFinder
A toy application for discovering which rune words can be made in Diablo II.

# Why?
Because I am bad at inventory management and can never remember which runes go to which rune words.

## ...you realize making this takes way more time than googling it, right?
Fine. In reality, I had been searching for a mini-project to pursue while working with a new tech stack.

This project is being built with **React** for its front-end, **C#** for the backend, and **Mongo** as it's database. This particular \
stack was chosen primarily because I either had not worked with or had limited experience with each technology.

## Alright, that makes sense. Why is your main directory post-fixed with a 4?
It's called iterative design. Theoretically, I would be working with a client and incorporating feedback on a regular basis.

## The other three don't even start do they?
Oh god no. Not even a little.
